# LSP-julia

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/sublimelsp/LSP-julia)](https://github.com/sublimelsp/LSP-julia/blob/master/LICENSE)

A plugin for the [LSP](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) client in Sublime Text with support for the [Julia language server](https://github.com/julia-vscode/LanguageServer.jl).

## Requirements & Installation

* [Julia](https://julialang.org/) must be installed on your machine.
  If the `julia` executable is not in your PATH, you need to provide the full path to the executable in the LSP-julia package settings.
* The [Julia package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Julia) from Package Control should be installed for syntax highlighting and allows the language server to start for Julia source files.
* Install the [LSP package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/LSP) and *LSP-julia* from Package Control.
  When a Julia file is opened for the first time after installing this package, the language server will automatically be installed via the Julia package manager (this can take 1-2 minutes).
* Optionally install the [Terminus package](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Terminus) from Package Control for a simple Julia REPL integration and some functionality to run code (see below).

## Features

Most of the standard LSP features like auto-completion, documentation on hover, or goto definition are supported by the Julia language server.
Some features like diagnostics require that a folder was opened in Sublime Text, and will not work in single file mode.

LSP-julia provides additional commands which are available from the command palette:

| Command label | Key binding | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| LSP-julia: Change Current Environment | none | Select the Julia project environment you are working in. The packages from this environment are used by the language server to provide autocomplete suggestions and for diagnostics/linting. Dependent on the number of packages, it might take a while for the server to do a package indexing process in the background, after switching to a different environment. |
| LSP-julia: Documentation | none | Search the Julia documentation and open the results in a tab. You can also right-click on a word in a Julia file and select "Show Documentation" from the context menu to open the corresponding documentation page. |
| LSP-julia: Open Julia REPL in Panel<sup>1</sup> | none | Open a Julia REPL, started in the directory of the active file, or focus if already running. |
| LSP-julia: Open Julia REPL in Tab<sup>1</sup> | none | Same as above, just use a normal tab instead of the bottom panel for the REPL. |
| LSP-julia: Select Code Block | none | Select the function or code block at the current cursor position. For multiple active cursors, only the topmost cursor position is taken into account. |
| LSP-julia: Run Code Block<sup>1</sup> | <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> | If text is selected, run it in a Julia REPL. Otherwise, run the code block containing the current cursor position and move curser to the next block. |
| LSP-julia: Run Code Cell<sup>1</sup> | <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> | If text is selected, run it in a Julia REPL. Otherwise, run the code cell containing the current cursor position and move curser to the next cell. Code cells are signalized with a specially formatted comment at the start of a line: `##`, `#%%` or `# %%`. |
| LSP-julia: Run Testitem | none | Show a quick panel with all available `@testitem`s in Julia files (see description below). |

Commands marked with a <sup>1</sup> are only available if you have the Terminus package installed.

To add or adjust key bindings for the commands, edit the `.sublime-keymap` file for your OS in your `Packages/User` folder.
For an example refer to the [Default.sublime-keymap](Default.sublime-keymap) file in this repository, and for the command names from this package see [LSP-julia.sublime-commands](LSP-julia.sublime-commands).

### Run individual test items

LSP-julia has a custom feature, similar to the Julia extension for VS Code, which allows to run individual testsets from a Julia package directly from the editor UI.

For this to work, the tests must be contained within a `@testitem` block, which is basically a replacement for `@testset`.
For an example see the screenshot below or read the detailed description at https://github.com/julia-vscode/TestItemRunner.jl#writing-tests.

> **Note**
> The `@testitem` has an isolated scope. The package to be tested is loaded implicitly through `using`. To access unexported symbols, either export them or call them by prepending the module name. (i.e. `MyPackage.foo()`)

A `@testitem` can be run via the "Run Test" link shown in an annotation on the righthand side of the editor, or via the "LSP-julia: Run Testitem" command from the command palette.
Possible test failures or errors will be shown as annotations at the position in the code where they occured.

> **Note**
> The `@testitem` feature only works in [project environments](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/code-loading/#Project-environments), i.e. you must have opened a folder in the sidebar which contains a *Project.toml* file with a `name` and `uuid` field.

To completely disable this feature, you can toggle off the following entry in the *LSP-julia.sublime-settings* file:
```json
{
  "initializationOptions": {
    "julialangTestItemIdentification": false
  }
}
```
